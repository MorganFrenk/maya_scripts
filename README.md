Scripts for Autodesk Maya

###### maya_add_group_suffix.py
Adds '_low' suffix to objects in group.

###### maya_group_bases_on_poly.py
The script compares the polycount of two objects to return the correct naming. An object with a lower polycount retains its original naming, acquiring the suffix '_low', a larger one with a polycount receives the name of an object with a lower polycount, but the suffix '_high'.
